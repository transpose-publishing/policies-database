# Contributing to TRANSPOSE

Thanks so much for your interest in contributing to TRANSPOSE!

Peer review is foundational to our current system of creating and sharing knowledge, yet almost everything about this process is typically shrouded in secrecy. In order to enable conversations about how to make this process more open, accessible, and fair, more systemic transparency around journal policies and practices is needed. To accomplish this, we'll build a user-editable database of journal policies on the openness of peer review, the recognition of early career researchers who contribute to peer review, and detailed policies on preprinting. We'll build off of the [SHERPA/RoMEO database](http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/index.php), which contains information about preprint archiving and also an ontology of journals, publishers, and policy groups.

These guidelines will help you get involved with TRANSPOSE.
